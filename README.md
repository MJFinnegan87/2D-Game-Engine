# 2D-Video-Game-Framework
This will serve as the foundation for any 2D video game I create.

The purpose of this program is to serve as a framework from which most other 2d video games could be made, saving time, and allowing easier code reuse. The goal is to include all elements common to all or most 2d video games so that only unique aspects of a particular game need to be implemented.

So far, main character movement, character collision detection, bullet firing, and world drawing are all implemented. Gravity is optional for side-scrollers or top-down RPG's.

No instructions followed or other peoples' code were used, this work is completely my own.
