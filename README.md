# 2D-Game-Engine
This will serve as the foundation for any 2D video game I create.

The purpose of this program is to serve as a template from which most other 2d video games could be made, saving time, and allowing easier code reuse. The goal is to include all elements common to all or most 2d video games so that only unique aspects of a particular game need to be implemented when using this template.

So far, main character movement, character collision detection, bullet firing, and world drawing are all implemented. Future features will include gravity for side-scrolling type games, support for enemy movement and attack, a level editor, a database for level data to be stored, and joystick support.

This project is still being worked, and it is a rewarding experience learning about and implementing screen drawing, image/sprite manipulation, nested for loops over arrays, and keypress handling.
